This web application uses the Google Maps and Google Places API to return a map of bars around the user's zip code. The map is populated with info-markers that list the bar's name, address, whether or not it is currently open, and it's rating(out of 5) by other google users.

Additionally, it uses the OpenWeather API to return current weather conditions in that area.
